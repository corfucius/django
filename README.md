# django
A django practice blog based on Traversy Media django crash course.
This project sets up a framework that can be expanded into a more full fledged django app. So far, I have added the ability 
upload pics through django admin, and changed some of the styling, added official django images etc. I thought something like 
this might be the beginings of a new section to my website.
